## General Information

Welcome to the Big Data Computing class!

This is a first-semester course of the [MSc in Computer Science at the Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.studiareinformatica.uniroma1.it/master-course-computer-science).

This repository contains class material along with any useful information for the 2024-2025 academic year.

The Big Data Computing course is divided into **two distinct modules**, each one carrying 3 CFUs (credits).<br/>
[Prof. Daniele De Sensi](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/users/danieledesensiuniroma1it) will lead the first module, while the second module will be taught by [Prof. Gabriele Tolomei](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/users/gabrieletolomeiuniroma1it).<br/>
Importantly, these modules will **not** run concurrently; once the first module concludes, the second will begin.

### Class Schedule
- **Wednesday** from **10:00 a.m.** to **12:00 p.m.** (Aula Magna - "Building C" - Viale Regina Elena 295 [[map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ATTqBchq8B5cfKNp8)])
- **Thursday** from **1:00 p.m.** to **4:00 p.m.** (Room 1L - Via Del Castro Laurenziano, 7a [[map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i8KBFnCxPJrnbWhq8)])

### Moodle Web Page
Students must subscribe to the Moodle web page using the same credentials (username/password) to access the Wi-Fi network and Infostud services at the following link: https://elearning.uniroma1.it/course/view.php?id=18525
All the information will be provided through GitHub, whereas Moodle will be used as a repository for the course material.

### Description and Goals
The amount, variety, and rate at which data is being generated nowadays, both by humans and machines, are unprecedented. This opens up a number of challenges on dealing with those data, as traditional computing paradigms are not conceived to operate at such a scale.

"Big Data" is the umbrella term that has rapidly become popular to describe methodologies and tools specifically designed for collecting, storing, and processing very large or complex data sets. In addition to addressing foundational computer science problems, such as searching and sorting, big data computing mainly focuses on extracting knowledge - thereby value - from large-scale data sets using advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning.

This course is intended to provide graduate-level students with a deep understanding of programming models and computer architectures that are suitable for the large-scale analysis of data. More specifically, the course will give students the ability to understand challenges and solutions in developing big data/machine learning workloads, and to tackle real-world problems faced by the so-called "Big Five" tech companies (i.e., Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook): text/graph analysis, classification/regression, and recommendation, just to name a few.

### Prerequisites
The course assumes that students are familiar with the basics of data analysis and machine learning, properly supported by a strong knowledge of foundational concepts of calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, and computer architectures. 

### Exams

The exam will consist in an oral exam.
<!-- UNCOMMENT BELOW IF THE EXAM STAYS THE SAME
The exam will consist of a **seminar on a research paper** chosen from a curated list of distinguished conferences and journals that align with the topics covered in the course.<br/>
Since selecting a paper that simultaneously covers both units can be challenging, you can choose a research work that prevalently concerns one of the two units. For example, you can select work on big data architectures (first unit) or high-dimensional data representation learning (second unit).<br/>
Each seminar can be done **individually** or in a **group of at most two students**.<br/>
A document containing the main guidelines for the final exam is available [here](./extra/Final_Exam_Guidelines.pdf).

### Recommended Textbooks
No textbooks are mandatory to successfully follow this course. However, there is a huge set of references which may be worth mentioning, especially to those who wants to dig deeper into some specific topics. Among those, some readings I would like to suggest are as follows:
- _Mining of Massive Datasets_ [Leskovec, Rajaraman, Ullman] [available online](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf).
- _Big Data Analysis with Python_ [Marin, Shukla, VK]
- _Large Scale Machine Learning with Python_ [Sjardin, Massaron, Boschetti]
- _Spark: The Definitive Guide_ [Chambers, Zaharia]
- _Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis_ [Karau, Konwinski, Wendell, Zaharia]
- _Hadoop: The Definitive Guide_ [White]
- _Python for Data Analysis_ [Mckinney]
