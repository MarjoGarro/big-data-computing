### Description and Goals
The amount, variety, and rate at which data is being generated nowadays both by humans and machines are unprecedented. This opens up a number of challenges on how to deal with those data, as traditional computing paradigms are not conceived to operate at such a scale.

"Big Data" is the umbrella term that has rapidly become popular to describe methodologies and tools specifically designed for collecting, storing, and processing very large or complex data sets. In addition to addressing foundational computer science problems, such as searching and sorting, big data computing mainly focuses on extracting knowledge - thereby value - from large-scale data sets using advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning.

This course is intended to provide graduate-level students with a deep understanding of programming models and tools that are suitable for the large-scale analysis of data distributed across clusters of computers. More specifically, the course will give students the ability to proficiently develop big data/machine learning solutions on top of industry-standard frameworks, such as Hadoop and Spark, to tackle real-world problems faced by the so-called "Big Five" tech companies (i.e., Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook): text/graph analysis, classification/regression, and recommendation, just to name a few.

### Prerequisites
The course assumes that students are familiar with the basics of data analysis and machine learning, properly supported by a strong knowledge of foundational concepts of calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics. In addition, students must have non-trivial computer programming skills (preferably using Python programming language). Previous experience with Hadoop, Spark, or distributed computing is not required.

### Exams
Students must prove their level of comprehension of the subject by developing a **software project**, leveraging the set of methodologies and tools introduced during classes. Projects must of course refer to typical Big Data tasks: e.g., clustering, prediction, recommendation (just to name a few) using very-large datasets in _any_ application domain of interest.<br/>
Anyway, the topic of the project **must be first agreed with the teacher** through a proposal that must be sent **at least one month before** the targeted project submission deadline. **NOTE:** _Only the projects that have been successfully approved will be considered for grading!_<br/>
References where to select interesting projects will be suggested throughout the course (e.g., [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)). However, I strongly encourage you to come up with your own original ideas, as creativity will be very much appreciated.<br/>
Projects can be done either **individually** or in group of **at most 2 students**, and they should be accompanied by a brief presentation written in english (e.g., a few PowerPoint slides). Finally, there will be an oral exam where submitted projects will be discussed in english; other questions on _any_ topic addressed during the course may also be asked, but those can be answered either in english or in italian, as the student prefers.<br/>
A document containing the main guidelines for the final project will be made available soon. Please, stay tuned! <!--[here](./extra/Final_Project_Guidelines.pdf).-->

### Recommended Textbooks
No textbooks are mandatory to successfully follow this course. However, there is a huge set of references which may be worth mentioning, especially to those who wants to dig deeper into some specific topics. Among those, some readings I would like to suggest are as follows:
- _Mining of Massive Datasets_ [Leskovec, Rajaraman, Ullman] [available online](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf).
- _Big Data Analysis with Python_ [Marin, Shukla, VK]

## Environment Setup: TBA

<!--### PySpark + Databricks
In this course, we will be using the Python application programming interface to the Apache Spark framework (a.k.a. [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)), in combination with [Databricks](https://databricks.com/). This will allows you to write and execute PySpark (as well as pure Python, for that matters) in your browser, with:
- Zero configuration required;
- Free access to Databricks' powerful cloud infrastructure (including GPUs);
- Easy sharing.

#### Why Databricks?
Starting from this year, our Big Data Computing class at Sapienza has joined the [Databricks University Alliance](https://databricks.com/university). This is a very active community of educators and faculty members who collaboratively share ideas, thoughts, and actual material on how to improve their teaching experience of Data-Science-like classes, which ultimately allow students to learn the latest data science tools used in the industry.

#### Where Should I Start with Databricks?
The first thing you have to do in order to start using Databricks is to set up a personal account.
Databricks accounts come in two flavours: 
- **Full Platform** (_payment_, _14-day trial_)
- **Community Edition** (_free_)

The former is the standard payment account, which gives you access to the fully-fledged Databricks' data analytics platform based either on Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS computational resources.
The latter, instead, allows you to enjoy Databricks on Amazon AWS for free (of course with some limitations!)

For the aim of our class, students **must all** sign up for a personal **Databricks Community Edition** account using this [link](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html). 
Please, be sure to select the correct type of account, as highlighted in the snapshot below:

![Databricks Account Sign Up](./img/databricks_account.png)

For any further information, please follow the instructions provided in the [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/try-databricks.html#community-edition-1).

#### What Databricks Resources Should I Use?
Many big companies have started relying on Databricks platform for running their data analytics tasks. As such, Databricks is really well-documented and provides you with a lot of useful material to consult. Among such material, I would suggest you to check out the following:
- A self-paced training course, whose instructions on how to access it are available [here](./databricks/databricks_self_paced_training.pdf)
- A [four-part tutorial](https://databricks.com/discover/introduction-to-data-analysis-workshop-series) on data analyitics with Databricks
- The official [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/)

##

Optionally, you may also want to install PySpark on your own local machine.

(**NOTE:** This step is **not** required for passing this class)

### Local Mode Setup [Optional]
In case you would like to install and configure PySpark _also_ on your local machine, please follow the instructions described [here](./oldest/2019-20.md#Local-Mode-Setup). Note that those guidelines may refer to older (or, even worst, deprecated) versions of the required installation packages; please, see the official [PySpark documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/) for the the most updated installation instructions.
