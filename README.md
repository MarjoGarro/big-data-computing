## General Information

Welcome to the Big Data Computing class!

This is a first-year, second-semester course of the [MSc in Computer Science of Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.studiareinformatica.uniroma1.it/master-course-computer-science).

This repository contains class material along with any useful information for the 2021-2022 academic year.

### Class Schedule
- **Tuesday** from **5:00 p.m.** to **7:00 p.m.**
- **Wednesday** from **8:00 a.m.** to **11:00 a.m.**

### How to Attend Classes
According to the guidelines provided by Sapienza University to contrast the COVID-19 pandemic, the course will be held **both** in-person and remotely. For any further information, students must refer to the official documentation available on the [Sapienza website](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/notizia/covid-19-phase-3-person-and-online-classes-exams-and-graduation-sessions).

#### Attending Classes in Person: Room 1L - Via del Castro Laurenziano 7a
Students who are willing to attend classes in-person must issue their request through the [Infostud Lab App](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/notizia/new-apps-sapienza-students) or the [Prodigit Sapienza](https://prodigit.uniroma1.it/) online booking system, according to the rules established (please, see [here](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/notizia/covid-19-phase-3-person-and-online-classes-exams-and-graduation-sessions)). Once the booking is confirmed - according to the class schedule above - students must go to Room 1L, which is located in Via del Castro Laurenziano 7a.

#### Attending Classes Remotely: Zoom
Students who are willing to attend classes remotely online **must** register to the dedicated Zoom conference, using the following link: https://uniroma1.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAkdOysqjkiG9SU5I1rG-oENGV-RIfCxLwv

### Moodle Web Page
Students must subscribe to the Moodle web page using the same credentials (username/password) to access Wi-Fi network and Infostud services, at the following link: https://elearning.uniroma1.it/course/view.php?id=14454

### Office Hours
Please, drop me a message at <a href="mailto:tolomei@di.uniroma1.it">tolomei@di.uniroma1.it</a> in case you would like to schedule a meeting, either online (i.e., via Google Meet or Zoom) or in-person (i.e., in Room 106 located at the 1st floor of Building E in Viale Regina Elena 295).

### Description and Goals
The amount, variety, and rate at which data is being generated nowadays both by humans and machines are unprecedented. This opens up a number of challenges on how to deal with those data, as traditional computing paradigms are not conceived to operate at such a scale.

"Big Data" is the umbrella term that has rapidly become popular to describe methodologies and tools specifically designed for collecting, storing, and processing very large or complex data sets. In addition to addressing foundational computer science problems, such as searching and sorting, big data computing mainly focuses on extracting knowledge - thereby value - from large-scale data sets using advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning.

This course is intended to provide graduate-level students with a deep understanding of programming models and tools that are suitable for the large-scale analysis of data distributed across clusters of computers. More specifically, the course will give students the ability to proficiently develop big data/machine learning solutions on top of industry-standard frameworks, such as Hadoop and Spark, to tackle real-world problems faced by the so-called "Big Five" tech companies (i.e., Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook): text/graph analysis, classification/regression, and recommendation, just to name a few.

### Prerequisites
The course assumes that students are familiar with the basics of data analysis and machine learning, properly supported by a strong knowledge of foundational concepts of calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics. In addition, students must have non-trivial computer programming skills (preferably using Python programming language). Previous experience with Hadoop, Spark, or distributed computing is not required.

### Exams
Students must prove their level of comprehension of the subject by developing a **software project**, leveraging the set of methodologies and tools introduced during classes. Projects must of course refer to typical Big Data tasks: e.g., clustering, prediction, recommendation (just to name a few) using very-large datasets in _any_ application domain of interest.<br/>
Anyway, the topic of the project **must be first agreed with the teacher** through a proposal that must be sent **at least one month before** the targeted project submission deadline. **NOTE:** _Only the projects that have been successfully approved will be considered for grading!_<br/>
References where to select interesting projects will be suggested throughout the course (e.g., [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)). However, I strongly encourage you to come up with your own original ideas, as creativity will be very much appreciated.<br/>
Projects can be done either **individually** or in group of **at most 2 students**, and they should be accompanied by a brief presentation written in english (e.g., a few PowerPoint slides). Finally, there will be an oral exam where submitted projects will be discussed in english; other questions on _any_ topic addressed during the course may also be asked, but those can be answered either in english or in italian, as the student prefers.<br/>
A document containing the main guidelines for the final project is available [here](./extra/Final_Project_Guidelines.pdf).

### Recommended Textbooks
No textbooks are mandatory to successfully follow this course. However, there is a huge set of references which may be worth mentioning, especially to those who wants to dig deeper into some specific topics. Among those, some readings I would like to suggest are as follows:
- _Mining of Massive Datasets_ [Leskovec, Rajaraman, Ullman] [available online](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf).
- _Big Data Analysis with Python_ [Marin, Shukla, VK]
- _Large Scale Machine Learning with Python_ [Sjardin, Massaron, Boschetti]
- _Spark: The Definitive Guide_ [Chambers, Zaharia]
- _Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis_ [Karau, Konwinski, Wendell, Zaharia]
- _Hadoop: The Definitive Guide_ [White]
- _Python for Data Analysis_ [Mckinney]

## Environment Setup

### PySpark + Google Colaboratory
In this course, we will be using the Python application programming interface to the Apache Spark framework (a.k.a. [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)), in combination with [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or "Colab" for short). This will allows you to write and execute PySpark (as well as pure Python, for that matters) in your browser, with:
- Zero configuration required;
- Free access to Google's powerful cloud infrastructure (including GPUs);
- Easy sharing.

Of course, the same can be achieved also on your own local machine but that would require: _(i)_ dealing with clumsy installation issues that are very specific to your platform, and _(ii)_ sticking to "small" rather than real "big" data, as your machine cannot compare with Google's infrastructure!

Optionally, you may also want to install PySpark on your own local machine.

(**NOTE:** This step is **not** required for passing this class)

### Local Mode Setup [Optional]
In case you would like to install and configure PySpark _also_ on your local machine, please follow the instructions described [here](./oldest/2019-20.md#Local-Mode-Setup). Note that those guidelines may refer to older (or, even worst, deprecated) versions of the required installation packages; please, see the official [PySpark documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/) for the the most updated installation instructions.
